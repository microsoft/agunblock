  <b>Setup Utility to Unlock AI Agents for Your Development Workflow</b>
</p>


AGUnblock is an open-source utility that helps developers leverage AI agents for their Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) through Azure. This platform provides a centralized hub for discovering, configuring, and integrating various AI coding agents into your development workflow, with a focus on setting up and connecting different AI agents to Azure services. It streamlines the process of getting started with AI-powered development tools by providing automated setup assistance and Azure integration guidance.
